# webfont-loader

Load webfont using native FontFace with fall back to [font-face-observer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/font-face-observer) (see [web font loading detection, without timers](http://smnh.me/web-font-loading-detection-without-timers/) for details on how the fallback works).

Currently aimed at WOFF fonts for modern browsers so your experience may vary -- definitely want to make it more rounded but it is early code.
